<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Paritosh, from New Delhi. Right now I am living in Chennai for working purpose.
  I am working as a Technical Service Engineer in Fujitsu.</p>

<p>I like Japanese language. So after studing for approximately two years for it 
  simultaneously with my previous job, I cleared till JLPT N2 level and also aiming for N1 in upcoming future.
I am kind of a life long learner.</p>

 To teach people Japanese online . Nowadays I am following Web development course by Angela Yu, it's excellent I think.
